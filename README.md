# Cybersecurity-Bootcamp-Capstone-Project-Vertical Institute 2024
As part of a cybersecurity bootcamp, this capstone project focuses on identifying and mitigating cybersecurity risks faced by Vertical Bank, a fully digital financial institution in Singapore. Given the rise in financial fraud, scams, and cyber threats, the project involves analyzing a real-world security incident affecting the financial sector, identifying key risks, threats, and vulnerabilities, and proposing security controls and mitigation strategies. The project requires the development of security policies, incident response actions, and protection mechanisms for personally identifiable information (PII) and critical business processes. The final deliverable includes a stakeholder presentation for the bank’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), outlining research findings, security recommendations, and an incident response communication plan to enhance Vertical Bank’s cybersecurity posture.
